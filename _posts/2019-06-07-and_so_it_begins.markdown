Everyone always dreams about what they want to acheive and how they feel their life should unfold. Dreaming and talking about it is one thing, but actually finding the courage to **do it** and persue it is another. I've thought about coding for a while and drempt about what I could accomplish for myself in the long run with this career path. I was very hesitant at first, but then finally went for it and it has been very interesting to say the least. My love for computers and electronics in general has grown especially over the past decade and being able to work this in depth with coding and software engineering is more than what I could have ever asked for. Thank you for being here in the beginning steps of this very long journey; And so it begins..
